# 🏡 House Price Prediction  

This project focuses on predicting house prices using **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** models. The dataset undergoes **data exploration, feature selection, and model evaluation** to determine the best predictive approach.  

## 📌 Project Overview  

The goal is to build machine learning models to predict house prices based on key features. We experiment with **Decision Trees**, optimizing tree size using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and compare it with a **Random Forest** model for improved accuracy.  

## 📂 Folder Structure  

- `data/` - Contains the dataset (`house_data.csv`).  
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter Notebooks with analysis, feature selection, and model building.  
- `README.md` - Overview of the project.  

## 🛠 Steps Performed  

1. **Data Exploration** – Understanding relationships between features and prices.  
2. **Feature Selection** – Identifying key factors influencing house prices.  
3. **Model Building** – Training models using **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest**.  
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning** – Selecting optimal tree size based on **MAE**.  
5. **Evaluation** – Comparing model performance to find the best predictor.
