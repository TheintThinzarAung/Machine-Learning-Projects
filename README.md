# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository contains machine learning projects that demonstrate my ability to build, train, and evaluate machine learning models using Python. 

## Projects:
- **üè° House Price Prediction**: This project focuses on predicting house prices using **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** models. The dataset undergoes **data exploration, feature selection, and model evaluation** to determine the best predictive approach.  



## Technologies:
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Folder Structure:
- **data/**: Datasets used in each project
- **models/**: Saved models and evaluation results
- **analysis/**: Jupyter Notebooks with model-building steps
